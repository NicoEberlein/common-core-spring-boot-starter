== Const Generator

These classes are used for the Maven plugin Const Generator and
are used to create classes with references to functions and
variables. This way they can be referenced directly
and changes to the structure lead already in
compiletime and not in runtime.

NOTE: Deprecated, should be replaced by summer-fresco or lombok. 
should be replaced.
