== Lambda Functions

The lambda functions extend the existing functions by variants
with additional parameters. The classes 'FunctionX' have a return value, 
the classes 'ConsumerX' none. Use these classes to create simple 
lambda functions with multiple parameters.


== Thread Control

When a thread is created with MThread a context is created via 
ThreadControl a context is created over the settings
from the parent thread to the new thread.

Some settings are fixed. Further 
settings can be added by registering 
`IThreadControl` can be added.
